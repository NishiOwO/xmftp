v0.93alpha	-	Tue Apr 15 1997
---------------------------------------

	- First release, many things not finished, probably many bugs

v0.94alpha	-	Tue Apr 15 1997
---------------------------------------

	- Added Cancel button on remote deletion (whoops)

v0.9.5		-	Thu Apr 17 1997
---------------------------------------

	- Finished Local menu and Remote menus operations

v0.9.6		-	Sat Apr 19 1997
---------------------------------------

	- Better processing of symlinks (now sanely downloadable and
	  viewable). If you are downloading multiple files and some
	  of them are symlinks, the 'total' information will be
	  wrong, as the symlinks' bytesizes are not found out until
	  the start of the transfer of that certain symlink. Only at
	  that point will the 'total' information will be updated to
	  include the symlinked file. This will probably be fixed later.

	- The above applies to local symlinks and uploading as well

	- symlinks to directories locally or remotely are NOT transferred

v0.9.7		-	Sun May  4 1997
---------------------------------------

	- Added support for Windows NT FTP servers (like ftp.idsoftware.com)
		- Unfortunately these servers do not support resume :(
	- Added support for WAR-FTPD servers
	- Added overwrite confirmation when server does not support resume
	  feature. Note that this confirmation interrupts transfers as a
	  whole.. if the user answers NO for the confirmation, the whole
          transfer is terminated. This will probably be done in a nicer
	  fashion later.
	- Updated BUGS file

v0.9.8		-	Thu May 15 1997
---------------------------------------

	- Now using XPM library for icons instead of crappy XmGetPixmap
		- You can use your own icons too (XPMs only). Take a look in
		  /usr/local/lib/xmftp/icons/ and replace them at will
			- If you do replace them, keep a backup of your
			  new icons becuase the next 'make install' will
			  wipe them!
		- You MUST have the XPM library to compile!
        - Using the binary release some had trouble connecting to
          sites (gethostbyname error). SHOULD be fixed now (using nslookup).
	  Let me know if there are still problems.
		- If you are compiling AND are having a gethostbyname
		  problem, see the FAQ
	- Changed compilation link line, maybe this will help you all
	  that are getting undefined references?
	  (suggested by mrxray@pop.slip.net)
	- Added port support (suggested by glsmith@whale.st.usm.edu)
		- Ports for a site can only be set via the Site Manager

v0.9.9		-	Thu May 15 1997
---------------------------------------

	- Sites that did not have fully qualified domain names could not be
	  connected to. fixed....
	- Better (hopefully) parsing of nslookup output

v1.0.0		-	Mon May 19 1997
---------------------------------------

	- Added Site command support (in the Remote menu)
	- No longer have to fill in all fields when entering sites into
	  the site manager. If login or password field is blank,
	  anonymous login is used.
	- Shortened timeouts on certain operations (connection etc)
	  This is set to 30 seconds by default.
	- Now a window can be brought up upon a connection that shows
	  server responses.
	- Now has an option menu for general settings
	- Added Troubleshooting section to FAQ - please read if you encounter
	  problems.

v1.0.1		-	Thu Jun 26 1997
---------------------------------------

	- Added file modification times in directory listing
	- Font sizes can be changed via .Xdefaults, check the FAQ for
	  an example to make directory listing font smaller.
	- Added sorting capabilities on time or name (via Local and Remote
	  menus)
	- Less frequent updating of transfer stats (at least 1 second 
	  before refresh)
	- On some slow transfers, screen would not refresh for possibly
	  long amounts of time... fixed. Refresh is forced every 5 seconds.
	- URL capabilites added to command line and quick connect. This is 
	  handy when copying an ftp URL to the clipboard from a webpage in
	  netscape. You can just paste it in the quick connect dialog and 
	  xmftp will call the site and retrieve the specified file. You
	  can also specify the URL on the command line.

v1.0.2		-	Mon Jul  7 1997
---------------------------------------

	- RTM mode was not working in the binary release (or compilation
	  with 'make bad_gethostbyname'). xmftp would just hang...fixed
	- The following options have been added to General Settings:
		- Toggle for large or small font setting. xmftp now defaults
		  to a smaller font. For those that want more control of the
		  font, take a look at the FAQ
		  NOTE:	previous modifications to ~/.Xdefaults regarding
			LIST_TAG will not take affect! See the FAQ for the
			new tagnames
		- Toggles for showing hidden files or not
		- Toggle for cropping of filenames. Normally, when xmftp
		  encounters a long filename, it crops it (adding "..."),
		  but sometimes you would like to see the whole filename
	- Stop button during transfers should work properly in most window
	  managers now

v1.0.3		-	Fri Jul 18 1997
---------------------------------------

	- Password entries are now *'ed out when entering them

	- Standalone executable that has icons built in
	  (no more /usr/local/lib/xmftp and root-required installs)

	- 8bit icons are built in as well, so xmftp SHOULD work on
	  8bit displays (let me know if there are problems)

	- You can still use your own icons, see the FAQ for details

	- No longer have to be root to install/run

	- Added Appearance section to FAQ - look there for simple ways to
	  improve how xmftp looks

	- Can now type in directories right in the directory fields instead
	  of hitting the 'CD...' buttons

	- No longer have to store passwords within xmftp. You can leave
	  the password field blank in the Site Manager and xmftp will prompt
	  you for a password upon connect

		- URLs unfortunately still have to be of the strict form:

		  ftp://[user:password@]site.domain.com/dir1/...
		  
		  where '[user:password@]' is either totally omitted or
		  all there. Type 'xmftp -help' for more info.

	- Explanation of RTM mode in FAQ - Read to see if you should use it

	- Added recognition of some AIX ftpd's that report they are running
	  an 'UNKNOWN' system (untested, may still be problematic)

	- Fixed a bug dealing with downloading symlinks (size recognition)

v1.0.4		-	Wed Aug 20 1997
---------------------------------------

	- Cleaned up memory usage

	- now can add a currently connected to site to the site manager

		- If you call a new site, going to the site manager
		  while connected will give you an extra button called
		  'Add current site' to quickly add the site

	- faster directory listings (up to 50% faster)

	- non-flat site database file

	- xmftp should not start out with a ridiculous window size when using
	  resolutions below 1024x768

	- statically linked binary now has only Motif statically linked

	- no longer using nslookup
