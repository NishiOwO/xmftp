			xmftp Quick and Dirty Install

	0) tar xvzf xmftp-???.tar.gz
	   cd xmftp

	1) Read the FAQ and BUGS file to know what you are getting into.

	2) cd source

	3) If you have an xmftp BINARY package, skip to step 6.

	4a) Edit the Makefile and make sure everything is OK. The Makefile
	    assumes that Motif is installed in the standard location and
	    the X/Motif libraries are found in /usr/X11R6/lib and the
	    installation root dir is /usr/local

	4b) You may have to edit ui/Makefile as well if your headers
	    cannot be found

	5) make

	6) If all went well you should have an 'xmftp' binary in the
           current directory. If you would like to install it in a
	   standard location (not necessary), become root and do:

           make install

	7) email valankar@bigfoot.com with your comments and/or suggestions.
