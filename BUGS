BUGS and things not finished:

	Alas, the inevitable. xmftp is a work in progress so some features
	may not even work. I have listed them below.

	Application Bugs

	- Unsuccessful transfers die 'quietly' with no feedback

	- Speed indicator (and Total ETA) in transfer dialog can be quite
	  meaningless when transferring many small files

	- These functions are NOT implemented as of yet but may be soon:
		- Option to disable resume
		- More file information such as permission bits, group, owner.
		- Resumable UPloads
		- Compatibility with NcFTP's bookmarks file
		- Encrypted password storage
		- 'quote' command

	- Resuming works on a FILENAME basis only. If a local file exists
	that has the same name as a remote one you are trying to download
	AND it is smaller in size, it is resumed.

	- Currently, xmftp supports the following remote systems:
		UNIX (like wu-ftpd)
		some UNIX servers that don't have the SYST command (like
			some Solaris/SunOS) no resuming though!
		WAR-FTPD
		Windows_NT (like ftp.idsoftware.com) no resuming though!

	I think there is a problem with SERV-U ftpd's, though I don't know
	of any SERV-U servers running off hand.

	If you run into a public server that is not supported by xmftp,
	please let me know at valankar@bigfoot.com. Give me the address of the
	unsupported site and I will try to include support for it in the
	next version of xmftp.

	- Sites (unix or not) that don't request a password will not work
	as of yet. I've only found one site that does this (ftp.troll.no).

	- xmftp may lock up when performing a task and the remote host
	becomes unreachable for some reason. If you are idle for a long time,
	it is best to select Reconnect or you'll probably get a seg fault.

	Appearance Bugs

	- Resizing sometimes makes the CD... buttons get clipped
