The obligatory revision history...

Changes from 8/31/96 version to 3/15/97 version

1) Added copyright information to sources.

2) Changed from 'port' to 'pasv' which I'm told will allow the routines
   to work from behind a firewall.  It's also a lot simpler and cleaner
   than all that code to setup and accept a connect from the server.

3) Added delete (ftprm) support to qftp.c.

4) Modified qftp to allow use without a softlink by passing the ftp
   command as the first argument.

5) Added netbuf argument to all calls to eliminate static storage and
   allow multiple simultaneous connections.

6) Renamed routines from ftp*() to Ftp*() to avoid problems with existing
   programs.  Added macros in libftp.h to support old interface.  Renamed
   ftpOpen() to FtpConnect().
