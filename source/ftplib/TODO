Here are some things which users have asked for that I haven't gotten
around to yet or haven't figured out how to implement it yet.

- Pass data to calling program instead of to file

	I'm not sure how I would really want to handle this.  Callbacks?
	Create the data connection and give the data socket fd to the
	user?  Maybe ftpRead() and ftpWrite() functions?

- Percentage complete indication

	Do I want to do this in ftplib.c or somehow tie it into allowing
	the user program to do the I/O?  I could parse the size out of
	the 'retr' response and give it to the user.  Let the user do the
	calculations while they are reading/writing the socket.

- C++ support

	I haven't done enough C++ to be able to generate the object model
	myself.  I'm open to ideas on how to set this up.
